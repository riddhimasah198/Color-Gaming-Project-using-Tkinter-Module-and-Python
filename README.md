# Colour Game with Tkinter

The Color Game is a fun and interactive Python game built using Tkinter, where players test their ability to recognize and match color names with their corresponding colors. The game displays a color name (such as "Red") and several color buttons. The objective is to click the button that correctly represents the color name, not the word itself. Players earn points for correct answers and lose points for mistakes. The game includes a countdown timer, making it more challenging as players race against the clock to score as high as possible. Perfect for anyone who loves color and word puzzles!
